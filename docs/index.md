# User documentation

YJump is a fully featured parkour plugin, originally developed for [YCraft](ycraft.fr). The plugin is intended to be
used on Bukkit like server, from version 1.12.2 to 1.16.4 (the latest tested version). It should support all forks (Spigot,
PaperMC, etc...), but using Bukkit may cause some issues as some features might be missing.

The version 2.0 is currently under development and latest builds can be found on the
[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/nowtryz/YJump/releases).

> Note: if you are migrating from 1.x, consider taking a look to the [migration guide](migrating-from-V1.md)
